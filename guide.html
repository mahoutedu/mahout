        <h2>Intro</h2>
        <p>This app provides a tool to accelerate the reading learning process for young children. By following the simple methods outlined here, you can teach a child to read in just 10 minutes a day—with love, care, and fun.
<p>This toolset is specifically designed for kids to learn the challenging skill of reading, which involves progressing from recognizing individual letter sounds to blending these sounds while reading full words and sentences. It is suitable for children who already know how to sound out letters. For example, if a child can sound out the letter 'm' as “mmm” (IPA /m/) or the letter 'a' as “aaa” (IPA /æ/), then they are ready to learn from this app.

    <div class="section" id="how-to">
        <h2>How to</h2>
      <p> A critical skill for children to develop while reading is sound blending. To read a complete word, which is a combination of letters, the sounds of each individual letter must be blended from left to right. For example, the word ‘fun’ should not be read as ff--uu--nn but rather as ffuunn without pauses between the letter sounds. The challenging part is teaching children not to pause between sounds but to blend them. To address this, we suggest never pausing between letter sounds while teaching and explicitly teaching them what is called Connected Phonation. Using the “C” tool, a tactile visual method, helps both the teacher and the child track the letters from left to right and continuously blend the sounds. This is effective in teaching connected phonation.

<p>Another challenge for children is remembering new sounds when they encounter digraphs. Digraphs are pairs of letters that, when combined, produce a different sound than when they are separate. For example, the word ‘ship’ is read as “sh-i-p” rather than “s-h-i-p”. To help children learn this, we use font color differences in the word to remind them that there is a digraph. This is controlled by the “D” tool, which can be toggled on or off.

        <h2>Teaching Plan:</h2>
<p>- First practice lessons 1-5. Then lesson 6. Teach connected phonation throughout these lessons as shown in Demo1
<p>- Then practice lesson 7-9. Finally finish off with lesson 10. Again, teach connected phonation and remind them digraphs through the “D” button. See Demo2.
<p>- Use "Custom" button to interject new words in each lesson so that you know the kids learnt the skills for reading. See <a href="https://youtube.com/shorts/oBGeU4Jc7og" id="demo3">Demo3</a>.</p>

    <div class="section" id="what-not-to-do">
        <h2>What Not to Do</h2>
        <p>Do not teach segmented phonation
<p>Do not teach them letter names initially, as they are not useful for reading. Teach them letter names after they are comfortable with reading words and sentences
<p>Avoid saying "A is for Apple, B is for Bat," as it can confuse and waste memory, although children have excellent memory.
<p>The recommended learning time span is 10 minutes and not more than 20 minutes. This refers to effective learning time, not the total session time.
<p>Do not introduce new symbols for digraphs.
<p>Use gamification to teach, not just to entertain.
