        <h2>Intro</h2>
        <p>This app gives the toolset to accelerate the learning of reading for a young child. With simple methods outlined here, you can teach a child to read in just 10 min a day – with love, care and fun.
<p>This toolset was specifically built for kids to learn the “most difficult skill of reading” which is going from just knowing sounds of individual letters to blending these sounds while reading full words and sentences. So, this will be apt for kids who already know how to sound out letters. For example: If the kid can sound out the letter m as “mmm” (IPA /m/) Or Sound out the letter A as “aaa” (IPA /ae/), then one can be confident that the kid is ready to learn from this app.

    <div class="section" id="how-to">
        <h2>How to</h2>
      <p> An important skill to develop for kids while reading is the skill of <em>sound blending</em>. To read a complete word, which is a combination of letters, the sounds of each individual letter must be blended going from left to right.
Let's take the word ‘fun’. Of course, this should not be read as ff--uu--nn rather should be read as ffuunn without pauses in between letter sounds. The hard part is to teach kids not to pause in between letter sounds but to blend them. To solve this, while teaching we suggest being careful to never pause between letter sounds and explicitly teach them what is called as <em>Connected Phonation</em>. With the “C” tool we use a tactile visual method to help the teacher and the kid track the letters from left to right and continuously blend the sounds. This will be useful to teach connected phonation.
<p>Check out this <a href="https://youtube.com/shorts/PKuYWXjbxqk" id="demo1">Demo1</a>.</p>
<p> Another challenge for kids to overcome is to remember new sounds when they encounter Diagraphs. Diagraphs are letters which when in a particular sequence, they sound different. For ex: Take the word ‘Ship’. Its read as “shshiip” not as “sshhiip”. When the letter ‘s’ and ‘h’ together they sound different to when they are separate. To help kids learn this, we use subtle color differences in the word to remind them that there is a diagraph in the word. This is controlled by the “D” tool. You can toggle this on or off.
<p>Check out this <a href="https://youtube.com/shorts/w0BMMul3AK8" id="demo2">Demo2</a>.</p>
<p>- First practice lessons 1-5. Then lesson 6. Teach connected phonation throughout these lessons as shown in Demo1
<p>- Then practice lesson 7-9. Finally finish off with lesson 10. Again, teach connected phonation and remind them diagraphs through the “D” button. See Demo2.
<p>- Use "Custom" button to interject new words in each lesson so that you know the kids learnt the skills for reading. See <a href="https://youtube.com/shorts/oBGeU4Jc7og" id="demo3">Demo3</a>.</p>

    <div class="section" id="what-not-to-do">
        <h2>What Not to Do</h2>
        <p>Do not ever teach segmented phonation
<p>Do not teach them letter names, it's useless in reading. Teach them letter names after they are comfortable with reading words and sentences
<p>Do not say A is for Apple, B is bat. It just confuses and wastes memory although kids have excellent memory.
<p>Recommended learning time span is 10 min and not more than 20 min. And this is effective learning timespan not total session timespan.
<p>Do not teach them new symbols for diagraphs.
<p>Gamify to teach not to entertain.
